1, I ’ Ve never had a bank account before . Why don ’ t I just keep my money under the matters like grandpa does ? ,1,50,9,-1,-1
0," You know you would spend it . And also , money in the bank earns interest . ",0,50,9,-1,-1
1, But what if I need my money suddenly ? ,1,50,9,-1,-1
0," The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . ",0,50,9,-1,-1

After you've been here for a year , you qualify for a one-week vacation . The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour , and more than a half-day should predict three days .

0," Okay , that's good . I get it . ",0,54,7,-1,-1

0," Well , I don't really know , but I heard that they are having a separation for 2 months , and filed for divorce . ",0,55,4,-1,-1
1, That's really surprising . I always thought they are well matched . What about the kids ? Who get custody ? ,1,55,4,-1,-1
0," Masha , it seems quiet and makable , no quarrelling about who get the house and stock and then contesting the divorce with other details worked out . ",0,55,4,-1,-1
1," That's the change from all the back stepping we usually hear about . Well , I still can't believe it , Masha and Hero , the perfect couple . When would they divorce be final ? ",1,55,4,-1,-1

0, Should I call the police ? ,1,57,8,-1,-1

0," Okay , I think that will be all for me today . ",0,81,0,-1,-1
0,I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . ,2,82,9,-1,-1
1," Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . ",3,82,9,-1,-1
0," Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . ",1,82,9,-1,-1
1, Do you sell direct to shops ? ,1,82,9,-1,-1
0," Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . ",0,82,9,-1,-1
1, Do you keep a stock of these things ? ,1,82,9,-1,-1
0," In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . ",0,82,9,-1,-1
1," That is , your commission . ",0,82,9,-1,-1
0," Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . ",0,82,9,-1,-1
1, Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . ,0,82,9,-1,-1
0," The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . ",0,82,9,-1,-1
1," According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? ",1,82,9,-1,-1
0," We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . ",2,82,9,-1,-1
1," We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... ",3,82,9,-1,-1
0, Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? ,1,82,9,-1,-1
1," Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . ",0,82,9,-1,-1
0," Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . ",0,82,9,-1,-1
1," Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . ",2,82,9,-1,-1
0," Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? ",1,82,9,-1,-1
1," Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . ",2,82,9,-1,-1
0," All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . ",3,82,9,-1,-1
1, Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair . ,0,82,9,-1,-1
0,"Excuse me , I ’ m sorry to trouble you . My name is Susan Ransom , and I have placed several orders with you company . ",0,83,7,-1,-1

0, I wonder whether there are any changes in your prices . ,1,84,7,-1,-1
1," All these products are our best-selling lines . The prices of our products will change according to that of the international market demand . And we are always open to negotiate , especially on larger orders . What do you have in mind ? ",0,84,7,-1,-1
0, How long does your offer remain valid ? I need some time to get my supervisors on board with this plan . ,1,84,7,-1,-1
1, I understand . Our offer remains open for 4 days . ,0,84,7,-1,-1
0,"Hello sir , may I help you ? ",1,85,0,-1,-1
1," Yeah , I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet . ",2,85,0,-1,-1
0," I see . Well , you have come to the right place . We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers . ",3,85,0,-1,-1
1," Sounds good . I don ’ t want it to be too expensive , maybe something mid-range . ",0,85,0,-1,-1
0," We have this new ETC smart phone.It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications . It also has a built-in camera , mp3 player and touch screen . It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are . ",0,85,0,-1,-1

1," I will ! I ’ ll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! We can get a Labrador or a German Shepard ! ",0,86,0,-1,-1
0," What if we want to take a vacation ? Who will we leave it with ? Plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . ",1,86,0,-1,-1
1, Ok . How about we get a cat or a ferret ? ,2,86,0,-1,-1
0," We ’ re planning on having children soon , I don ’ t think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . ",3,86,0,-1,-1
1, Fine ! Let ’ s get a bird then ! We can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! A parrot would be awesome ! ,2,86,0,-1,-1

0,"Good evening , Mr . Lee and thank you for choosing our airline . We have just discovered that this flight is overbooked . Would you like to volunteer to give up your seat ? ",2,87,7,-1,-1
1, Overbooked ? Give up my seat ? I don ’ t understand . ,0,87,7,-1,-1
0, From time to time we have a situation in which there are more passengers than there are seats on the aircraft . That ’ s overbooked . ,0,87,7,-1,-1
1," I know what overbooked is , I just don ’ t understand how that could happen ? ",0,87,7,-1,-1
0," Actually it ’ s a common practice to overbook , as passengers often don ’ t take their flight as scheduled . Most of the time there is no problem but today , more passengers arrived than we have seats , ",0,87,7,-1,-1
1, So who has to stay behind ? ,1,87,7,-1,-1
0," Well , first we ask for volunteers . If someone like yourself volunteers , they receive a free round trip ticket to be used within one year . If no one volunteers we just have to select someone . ",0,87,7,-1,-1

1, It's 486 yuan . ,0,199,0,-1,-1
0,"Mrs . Wang , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable ? ",1,200,9,-1,-1
1," As I said before , your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the gap . ",2,200,9,-1,-1
0," Just to comply , we're ready to reduce the price by 5 percent . I hope this concession of ours will get the ball rolling . ",3,200,9,-1,-1
1, So do we . Certainly it's a step forward on your side . But the gap is still too wide . ,0,200,9,-1,-1
0," The ball is in your court , Mrs.Wang . What price would you suggest ? ",1,200,9,-1,-1
1," To make your offer workable , I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken . ",2,200,9,-1,-1
0," That won't do . You see , our profit margin is very narrow . It simply can't stand such a big cut . ",3,200,9,-1,-1
1," I hate to disappoint you , Mr . Brown , but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere . Do think it over , please . We sincerely hope our discussion will come to a successful conclusion . ",2,200,9,-1,-1
0," Well , I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction . Would you mind waiting a day or two , until I get a reply from the home office ? ",2,200,9,-1,-1
1," Not at all . Shall we meet again , say , on Friday morning ? ",2,200,9,-1,-1
0, Good . Friday morning at 9 . ,3,200,9,-1,-1

0," Yes , well , you haven't had one for 5 years . You should have one every year . ",2,204,6,-1,-1
1," I know . I figure as long as there is nothing wrong , why go see the doctor ? ",0,204,6,-1,-1
0," Well , the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early . So try to come at least once a year for your own good . ",2,204,6,-1,-1

0," Let me see here . Your eyes and ears look fine . Take a deep breath , please . Do you smoke , Mr . Smith ? ",1,204,6,-1,-1

1," Certainly sir , this is our train schedule . We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm . ",3,208,5,-1,-1
0, How long does it take to get there ? ,2,208,5,-1,-1
1," About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ’ d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive . ",0,208,5,-1,-1
0," Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time ! ",1,208,5,-1,-1
1," Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers . ",0,208,5,-1,-1

1, A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ? ,1,209,4,-1,-1
0, The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend . ,0,209,4,-1,-1
1, So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ? ,1,209,4,-1,-1
0, It sounds like it will be . ,0,209,4,-1,-1
1, I really hope it doesn't get cold . ,0,209,4,-1,-1
0," That would ruin things , I want to go so badly . ",0,209,4,-1,-1
1," The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know . ",0,209,4,-1,-1
0, That is true . The weather is constantly changing . ,0,209,4,-1,-1
1, It would be nice if the weather would never change . ,0,209,4,-1,-1
0," That would be great , then we could plan things sooner . ",0,209,4,-1,-1
1, True . Predictable weather would make life easier . ,0,209,4,-1,-1
0,"Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . ",0,210,7,-1,-1
1," If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . ",0,210,7,-1,-1
0," Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . ",0,210,7,-1,-1
1," But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . ",0,210,7,-1,-1
0, I doubt that . ,0,210,7,-1,-1
0,Do you eat a lot of healthy food ? ,1,211,0,-1,-1
1," Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind . ",0,211,0,-1,-1
0," You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt . ",0,211,0,-1,-1
1, What's special about these things ? ,1,211,0,-1,-1
0," Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled . ",0,211,0,-1,-1
1, Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now . ,0,211,0,-1,-1
0,"I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job . ",0,212,7,-1,-1

0," Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment . ",0,212,7,-1,-1
1, Is that so ? ,1,212,7,-1,-1
0," Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on . ",0,212,7,-1,-1
1, Have you decided ? ,1,212,7,-1,-1
0, Yes . I want to get a better job . ,0,212,7,-1,-1
1, Could you tell me why you want to quit ? ,1,212,7,-1,-1
0, I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues . ,0,212,7,-1,-1
1," Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ? ",1,212,7,-1,-1
0, I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay . ,0,212,7,-1,-1
1," OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay . ",0,212,7,-1,-1
0, Thank you so much for your advice . ,0,212,7,-1,-1
1, And every best wish for your new job . ,0,212,7,-1,-1

1, Let's take the bus . ,0,214,0,-1,-1
0," I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you . ",0,214,0,-1,-1
1, It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once . ,0,214,0,-1,-1
0," It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus . ",0,214,0,-1,-1
1," We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice . ",0,214,0,-1,-1
0," Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too . ",0,214,0,-1,-1
1," If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ? ",2,214,0,-1,-1
0," We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi . ",3,214,0,-1,-1
1, I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus . ,2,214,0,-1,-1
0, Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives . ,3,214,0,-1,-1
1, It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you . ,2,214,0,-1,-1

1, That's my problem . I don't have a lot of options . ,0,237,0,-1,-1
0," What do you mean ? This is a big store , isn't it ? ",1,237,0,-1,-1
1," Yes , but I have unusually big feet . That wouldn't be too much of a problem except that they're also very wide , and only a few brands sell shoes that I can fit into . ",0,237,0,-1,-1
0," So how do you usually go about buying shoes , then ? ",1,237,0,-1,-1
1," Well , first of all , I can only go to certain stores that can guarantee me a large selection . ",0,237,0,-1,-1
0," Well , you're in the right store . If they don't have it , no one will . ",0,237,0,-1,-1
1," After that I choose something from one of the few brands that I know will fit me . I prefer white , so I ask them to bring me a pair of white sneakers in my size . Since I ’ m usually only given one or two pairs of shoes that meet my qualifications , it makes it a very easy choice . ",0,237,0,-1,-1
0,what shall we do after the volleyball match ? ,1,238,0,-1,-1
1, how about going to the Olympic souvenir store to have a look ? I remember there is one in the gym . ,2,238,0,-1,-1

1," the five dolls are sold together as a set , and they're priced according to the size . The bigger they are the more expensive . ",0,238,0,-1,-1
0," oh , I see . If I buy more than a set , can I get any discount ? ",1,238,0,-1,-1
1, I don't think so . All the souvenirs of the Olympic Games are very hot right now . ,0,238,0,-1,-1
0, any other ideas ? ,1,238,0,-1,-1
1," there are lots of things , such as postcards , key chains , posters and various arts and crafts . ",0,238,0,-1,-1

1, I ’ m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere . ,2,292,9,-1,-1
0, I ’ m afraid I can ’ t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ’ Ve received from other sources . ,3,292,9,-1,-1
1, But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ’ s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries . ,2,292,9,-1,-1
0," I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ’ s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ’ t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ’ t changed much over the years . ",3,292,9,-1,-1
1," There ’ s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ’ s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price . ",2,292,9,-1,-1
0," Well , we ’ ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ’ ll have to try , I suppose . ",3,292,9,-1,-1

0, I need to talk to you about that new driver you ’ Ve hired . I think I am going to have some problems working with him . ,2,344,7,-1,-1
1, He seems to be quite qualified . If it is a personal problem I preferred if you would work out between yourselves . ,3,344,7,-1,-1
0,I can't stand the stupid guy any longer . It ' s unbelievable ! ,0,345,7,-1,-1
1," Oh , my dear lady . Take it easy . You should forgive a green hand like him . ",2,345,7,-1,-1
0, He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy . ,0,345,7,-1,-1
1, I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems . ,2,345,7,-1,-1
0," I have told him how to do it several times , but he's never listened to me . ",0,345,7,-1,-1

0," Oh , I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff . ",0,345,7,-1,-1
1," Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do , make sure you don't lose your temper . ",2,345,7,-1,-1

1, I disagree . All you have to do is respect the staff and their opinions . ,2,345,7,-1,-1
0,"hey , you look great ! how's everything ? ",1,346,6,-1,-1
1," yeah , you know what ? I've been going to the club regularly . The training really pays off . Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit . ",0,346,6,-1,-1

1," the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , I should also have a healthy and balanced diet . ",2,346,6,-1,-1
0, sounds reasonable . ,3,346,6,-1,-1
1, we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . ,2,346,6,-1,-1
0, and fruits ! ,2,346,6,-1,-1
1, surely it is . Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . ,2,346,6,-1,-1

0,what do you think about the public service advertisement for quiting smoking ? ,1,351,4,-1,-1
1," while I think it's great that they're trying to get people to quit smoking , but I don't really care for the advertisement . ",0,351,4,-1,-1
0, why not ? ,1,351,4,-1,-1
1, the fish hook that they use is quite disturbing ! ,0,351,4,-1,-1

1," I know , but I think it's not really appropriate for young children . ",0,351,4,-1,-1
0, I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking . ,0,351,4,-1,-1
1, all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty . ,0,351,4,-1,-1
0," perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow . ",0,351,4,-1,-1
1," I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them . ",0,351,4,-1,-1
0, that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad . ,0,351,4,-1,-1
1," you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking . ",0,351,4,-1,-1

1," For me , growing up in a big family always made me yearn for attention . I always wanted to be an only child so that I could always do what I wanted and so that I wouldn't ever have to share . ",0,395,4,-1,-1

1," So complicated ! Ok , what about this red wine stain ? How do I get it out ? ",1,396,0,-1,-1

1, Cool . Then I can just throw everything in the dryer for an hour and it ’ s all set right ? ,1,396,0,-1,-1

1, I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high . ,0,403,9,-1,-1
0, I ’ m surprised to hear you say so . You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years . ,0,403,9,-1,-1
1," We only ask that your prices be comparable to others . That ’ s reasonable , isn ’ t it ? ",2,403,9,-1,-1
0," Well , to get the business done , we can consider making some concessions in our price . But first , you ’ ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us , so that we may adjust our prices accordingly . ",2,403,9,-1,-1
1, The size of our order depends greatly on the prices . Let ’ s settle that matter first . ,2,403,9,-1,-1
0," Well , as I ’ Ve said , if your order is large enough , we ’ re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent . ",2,403,9,-1,-1
1," When I say your prices are much too high , I don ’ t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent . ",3,403,9,-1,-1
0, How much do you mean then ? Can you give me a rough idea ? ,1,403,9,-1,-1
1," To have this business concluded , I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help . ",2,403,9,-1,-1
0, Impossible . How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent ? ,3,403,9,-1,-1
1, I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers . It ’ s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet .

0," Well I am used to that , Mr . Parsons , so that ’ s not really a shock for me . ",0,542,7,-1,-1
1," Good , as long as you understand that . ",0,542,7,-1,-1

1," Yes , it ’ s a really nice neighborhood . ",0,580,0,-1,-1
0,"Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it . ",2,581,0,-1,-1
1," Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know.Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more . ",3,581,0,-1,-1
0, But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished . ,2,581,0,-1,-1
1, But don't you like this place ? I remember when we came to see it we thought it would be lovely . ,2,581,0,-1,-1
0," Well , only you liked it really , darling . ",3,581,0,-1,-1

0, What gift ? ,1,582,0,-1,-1
1," It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it . ",0,582,0,-1,-1
0, You refused the gift ? That's terrible . ,1,582,0,-1,-1
1," I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way . ",0,582,0,-1,-1
0, Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade . ,0,582,0,-1,-1
1, That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page . ,0,582,0,-1,-1

1, What ? What did you buy ? ,1,636,3,-1,-1
0, It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it ! ,0,636,3,-1,-1
1, What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ? ,1,636,3,-1,-1
0," There was a guy on the sidewalk.He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes.He said he had to get rid of them quick . ",0,636,3,-1,-1
1, And ? ,1,636,3,-1,-1
0, So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks . ,0,636,3,-1,-1
1, And it's a brick ? ,1,636,3,-1,-1
0, Yes . ,0,636,3,-1,-1
1, I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ? ,1,636,3,-1,-1
0," I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store.If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new . ",0,636,3,-1,-1
1, So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic . ,0,636,3,-1,-1
0," Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products.Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new . ",0,636,3,-1,-1
1, But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ? ,1,636,3,-1,-1
0, He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen . ,0,636,3,-1,-1
1," Aha ! Now I understand.You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk.So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated ! ",0,636,3,-1,-1
0," C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box . ",0,636,3,-1,-1
1, That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy.And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from.Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there.Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around.So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you.Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks . ,0,636,3,-1,-1
0," You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ? ",1,636,3,-1,-1

0, Thank you very much . We always welcome new customers . ,0,867,9,-1,-1
0,I think this spring is a good time for us to start looking . ,0,868,0,-1,-1
1, We should plan to move out of here before July . I'm tired of living in apartments . ,2,868,0,-1,-1
0," I know , dear . I am too . But we've just been too busy to look for a house . ",3,868,0,-1,-1
1, We need to find a good realtor . ,2,868,0,-1,-1

1, What do you mean ? ,1,868,0,-1,-1

1, And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ? ,1,868,0,-1,-1
0," Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . ",0,868,0,-1,-1
1, Why ? ,1,868,0,-1,-1
0," Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . ",0,868,0,-1,-1
1, Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . ,0,868,0,-1,-1
0, It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . ,0,868,0,-1,-1
