0, Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? ,2,33,7,-1,-1
1," Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . ",0,33,7,-1,-1

1," Yes , I did . But I wasn't qualified for most of the jobs that I was interested in . ",0,34,7,-1,-1
0," Listen . I will see what I can do , ok ? You go home and tell Lily about this problem you have now . She is your wife and I am sure she will understand . ",2,34,7,-1,-1

0," I see . Let me have a look . It seems that your toilet is clogged , and that ’ s why it won ’ t flush . Let me just get my plunger . No , that ’ s not working either . I suspect that there ’ s some sort of foreign object in the pipes that ‘ s causing a blockage . That ’ s what ’ s making your toilet overflow . ",3,40,0,-1,-1
1," Oh , that must be because of my four-year-old daughter . She is always flushing things down the toilet . You know how kids are . ",0,40,0,-1,-1
0," Yeah , I have a little one myself . Anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . Thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . I would also suggest fixing this faucet that isn ’ t shutting off properly . I could have it all finished by today if it ’ s urgent . ",0,40,0,-1,-1
1, That would be great ! Is it expensive ? ,1,40,0,-1,-1
0, Let ’ s see ... I would say about eight hundred dollars . ,0,40,0,-1,-1

1, I could have Suzy stay at my place . ,0,41,4,-1,-1
0," I don't want to do that to you , Karen . ",0,41,4,-1,-1
1, Why not ? ,1,41,4,-1,-1
0, Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . ,0,41,4,-1,-1

1, I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . ,0,41,4,-1,-1
0, Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free . ,2,41,4,-1,-1

1, I am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . Have you ever tried steamed fish ? ,1,46,0,-1,-1
0," Yes , I have . But the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . The fish is not well-done and too salty . ",0,46,0,-1,-1
1, That's the case . I think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . ,0,46,0,-1,-1
0, I have the same idea as yours . ,0,46,0,-1,-1
1, It's OK . Please have a taste of it . ,2,46,0,-1,-1

0, What about a draft at 120 days sight ? ,2,50,7,-1,-1
1, All right . But we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . ,2,50,7,-1,-1
0, A bank's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . You can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . ,3,50,7,-1,-1
1, Then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . You know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . ,2,50,7,-1,-1

1, That's fine with me . How much time are we going to have to work on this ? ,1,60,7,-1,-1

0,What dressing would you like on the salad ? ,1,61,0,-1,-1
1," French dressing , please . ",0,61,0,-1,-1

0,"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ? ",2,63,7,-1,-1
1," Sure . First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . ",2,63,7,-1,-1
0," Yeah , that's very important . ",3,63,7,-1,-1
1," So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . ",2,63,7,-1,-1
0, I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . ,3,63,7,-1,-1
1," That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . ",2,63,7,-1,-1
0, It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . ,3,63,7,-1,-1
1," It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . ",2,63,7,-1,-1
0, But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . ,3,63,7,-1,-1
1," I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . ",2,63,7,-1,-1
0, It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . ,3,63,7,-1,-1
1," You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . ",2,63,7,-1,-1
0, I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . ,3,63,7,-1,-1
1, You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . ,2,63,7,-1,-1
0, It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . ,3,63,7,-1,-1
1," It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . ",2,63,7,-1,-1
0,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ? ",1,64,7,-1,-1
1, No idea . Your guess is as good as mine . ,0,64,7,-1,-1
0, It better be more than last year . ,0,64,7,-1,-1
1," Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see . ",0,64,7,-1,-1
0,"I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed . ",2,65,7,-1,-1
1, What a pity ! ,0,65,7,-1,-1
0," If you don't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? ",2,65,7,-1,-1
1, That's OK . ,3,65,7,-1,-1

0," I should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . Do you have any suggestion in mind ? Our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . ",1,141,7,-1,-1
1," That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 . ",2,141,7,-1,-1

0, That's very expensive ! ,0,384,9,-1,-1
1, Not really . The credit card is a revolving account . You only pay interest on what you owe . ,0,384,9,-1,-1

0, All right . That sounds like fun . ,0,551,0,-1,-1
0,Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month.This is my reservation note . ,2,552,5,-1,-1

0,The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest . ,0,553,0,-1,-1
1, Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West . ,1,553,0,-1,-1
0," No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . ",0,553,0,-1,-1
1," You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ? ",1,553,0,-1,-1
0," Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . ",0,553,0,-1,-1
1, Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? ,1,553,0,-1,-1
0," Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . ",0,553,0,-1,-1
1, Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? ,1,553,0,-1,-1
0," Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . ",0,553,0,-1,-1
0,Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ? ,2,554,7,-1,-1
1," We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . ",1,554,7,-1,-1
0," You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . ",2,554,7,-1,-1
1," OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ? ",1,554,7,-1,-1
0," I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . ",2,554,7,-1,-1
1," OK , will do . ",3,554,7,-1,-1

0," Well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . ",0,557,7,-1,-1
1," Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . ",0,557,7,-1,-1
0," Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance . ",0,557,7,-1,-1
1," Ok , then we can sign up for it together . ",2,557,7,-1,-1

0, I'm afraid all the big tables are taken . ,0,559,0,-1,-1
0,"Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today . ",2,560,6,-1,-1
1," If you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results . ",2,560,6,-1,-1

1, We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need . ,2,560,6,-1,-1
0,"This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee . ",0,561,7,-1,-1
1, If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off . ,2,561,7,-1,-1
0, What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great . ,0,561,7,-1,-1
1, I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ? ,2,561,7,-1,-1
0, What's your proposal ? ,1,561,7,-1,-1
1," Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway . ",2,561,7,-1,-1
0, Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible ! ,3,561,7,-1,-1
1, What would you suggest ? ,1,561,7,-1,-1
0, The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go . ,2,561,7,-1,-1
1, That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . ,2,561,7,-1,-1
0, OK . We can meet halfway again . ,3,561,7,-1,-1

0, That is kind of weird ! What if she is a psycho or something like that ? ,1,649,4,-1,-1
1," It's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! I am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! I think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . ",0,649,4,-1,-1

1, How about a training course ? ,2,652,3,-1,-1

0, That's true . Some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . ,0,821,4,-1,-1
1," Actually , it's not the fault of the mobile phone . But people should have a proper attitude towards it . Mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . ",0,821,4,-1,-1

1," OK , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . ",3,845,4,-1,-1
0,I met a girl in elevator this morning . She works in a company upstairs . She said she envied the casual way we dress for work . She complained about the dress rule in her company . It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday . ,0,846,7,-1,-1
1," Well , I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . Now , I know the answer . ",0,846,7,-1,-1
0," You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ’ t that strict ? ",0,846,7,-1,-1
1," To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . ",0,846,7,-1,-1
0," But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ’ re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . ",0,846,7,-1,-1
0,What happened ? Why didn't he win ? ,1,847,4,-1,-1
1, Didn't you hear ? He was disqualified . ,1,847,4,-1,-1
0, How did that happen ? He's so talented ! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! ,1,847,4,-1,-1
1," If he didn't have any drug problems , he would have won . ",0,847,4,-1,-1
0, What ? What kind of drugs was he using ? ,1,847,4,-1,-1
1, He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . ,0,847,4,-1,-1
0, I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . ,0,847,4,-1,-1
1, They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . ,0,847,4,-1,-1
0, That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . ,0,847,4,-1,-1
1," I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! ",0,847,4,-1,-1
0," Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs . ",0,847,4,-1,-1
1," I agree . Hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . ",0,847,4,-1,-1
0, Let's hope so . ,0,847,4,-1,-1
0,"Cindy , how come nearly all the prime-time TV shows are comedies ? ",1,848,4,-1,-1
1, That's because Americans love sitcoms . ,0,848,4,-1,-1
0, Sitcoms ? ,1,848,4,-1,-1
1," Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . ",0,848,4,-1,-1
0," In Taiwan , prime-time shows are an hour long and most of them aren't comedies . ",0,848,4,-1,-1
1, I think Americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . ,0,848,4,-1,-1
0,Are you interested in history ? ,1,849,4,-1,-1
1," Yes , I am . I enjoyed studying it at school , though I had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . ",0,849,4,-1,-1
0," I love history , but I ’ Ve always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . ",0,849,4,-1,-1
1, I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks ! ,0,849,4,-1,-1
0, Some people say that history repeats itself . ,0,849,4,-1,-1
1," What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ? ",1,849,4,-1,-1
0," The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . ",0,849,4,-1,-1
1, I see . I think I ’ d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . ,0,849,4,-1,-1
0,You're looking great . ,0,850,3,-1,-1
1," You , too . ",0,850,3,-1,-1

0," Oh , that's easy . If it's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . That's my advice . ",0,851,3,-1,-1
1, It isn't that easy . I hate to quit my present job . People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . ,0,851,3,-1,-1
0, Then what about the salary ? Would you get more ? ,1,851,3,-1,-1
1," Yes , they say I would get a big sum . ",0,851,3,-1,-1
0, Have you discussed it with your wife ? ,1,851,3,-1,-1
1," Yes , she leaves it to me . ",0,851,3,-1,-1
0, As I say it the work is well worth try . After all you can get a higher salary . ,2,851,3,-1,-1
1, I have to think about it . ,3,851,3,-1,-1
0,Sybil . Is that spelt with an I or a Y ? ,1,852,4,-1,-1

0,I see Mike farmer has make it into the Olympic team . He beat the national record by 0.1 of a second . ,0,853,4,-1,-1
1, That ’ s great . He ’ s the best runner I ’ Ve seen this season . I ’ m sure he ’ ll win a medal at the Olympics . ,0,853,4,-1,-1
0, I think you ’ re right . I think we have a very good athletics team . They should do well in the Olympics . How many medals do you think we ’ ll win ? ,1,853,4,-1,-1
1," I really don ’ t know . I don ’ t think we ’ ll win many gold medals , but I think we should win several silver and bronze ones . ",0,853,4,-1,-1
0, What do you think our chance are in other events . ,1,853,4,-1,-1
1," In the last Olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . I think we ’ ll do well in those same events . ",0,853,4,-1,-1
0, We might get a gold medal in the sailing too . Our team put in a lot of practice . ,0,853,4,-1,-1
1, I think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . ,0,853,4,-1,-1
0, You are very optimistic ! ,0,853,4,-1,-1
0,"Helen , did you hear I ’ m having a party ? Next Saturday in my place . ",2,854,4,-1,-1

1," I will , do you want me to bring anything ? ",1,854,4,-1,-1
0," No , just bring yourself . I hope to see you there . ",2,854,4,-1,-1
0,It's said that John's broken up . ,0,855,4,-1,-1
1, Really ? But his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . ,1,855,4,-1,-1
0, I hear that John's leading a double wife . ,0,855,4,-1,-1
1, It's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . ,0,855,4,-1,-1
0,Let's play chess . ,2,856,4,-1,-1
1, I haven't played chess for a long time . ,3,856,4,-1,-1
0," That's all right , I'm a beginner . I've just learnt how to play . ",0,856,4,-1,-1
1," Look , there's a chessboard . Those two men have already finished playing . ",0,856,4,-1,-1

1," Oh , definitely . I remember , when I first arrived in Guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . ",0,857,4,-1,-1
0," Oh , yeah . Many Chinese like to bargain . It happens almost everywhere . ",0,857,4,-1,-1
1," I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . ",0,857,4,-1,-1
0, A shouting match ? You ’ re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ’ t believe it . ,0,857,4,-1,-1
1, I am not exaggerating at all . I ’ m telling you the truth . That was how I felt at that time . ,0,857,4,-1,-1
0," Yes , perhaps . Chinese usually don ’ t notice that sort of thing . Maybe it ’ s quite natural to us . ",0,857,4,-1,-1
1," Yes , absolutely true . ",0,857,4,-1,-1
0,"Excuse me , can you tell me the name of the book you read ? ",1,858,1,-1,-1

0, So he talks about you behind your back ? ,1,860,3,-1,-1
1, Yes . He's all nice and friendly to my face . But the second I turn around he stabs me in the back ! ,0,860,3,-1,-1
0, I had a worker like that once . She was always taking credit for my ideas . ,0,860,3,-1,-1

0," Not much . I had to pay an unexpected bill , so I needed the money back . ",0,870,4,-1,-1

0," That ’ s exactly what I am going to do ! I ’ Ve decided to create my own company ! I ’ m going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! ",0,895,4,-1,-1
1, Have you ever written up a business plan before ? ,1,895,4,-1,-1
0," Well , no , it can ’ t be that hard ! I mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that ’ s it , right ? ",1,895,4,-1,-1
1," You couldn ’ t be more wrong ! A well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . Then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . ",0,895,4,-1,-1
0," Well , that seems easy enough . ",0,895,4,-1,-1
1," Wait , there ’ s more ! Then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . What they are and how they are different from competitors ’ ? Then comes the hard part , a market analysis . You need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! You need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from GDP per capita to how many children on average the population has ! All this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . ",0,895,4,-1,-1
0, Geez . Is that all ? ,1,895,4,-1,-1
1," Almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . Here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . After all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! ",0,895,4,-1,-1
0, Umm . I think I ’ ll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! ,0,895,4,-1,-1
0,I hear that Mary got mad . ,0,896,4,-1,-1
1, So I heard . ,0,896,4,-1,-1

1," Yeah , if you ’ re a girl . ",0,898,4,-1,-1
0," Well , you just want to watch Dark Angel because of the hot girl . ",0,898,4,-1,-1
1, That ’ s not true . Dark Angel is a good show . ,0,898,4,-1,-1
0, It ’ s story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . ,0,898,4,-1,-1
1," O . K . , O . K . Let ’ s forget it . There ’ s a football game on too . ",2,898,4,-1,-1
0, No way . I ’ m watching Ally McNeal . Go to John ’ s to watch the game . ,3,898,4,-1,-1
0,It ’ s really terrible ! ,0,899,3,-1,-1
1, What are you talking about ? ,1,899,3,-1,-1
0, Don ’ t you see many parents are forcing there children ’ s hands to learn something they think important to their children . But the children are not interested in it at all . ,0,899,3,-1,-1
1, You said it . Many parents just don ’ t know how to educate their children . ,0,899,3,-1,-1
0,"Sarah , what did you do today ? ",1,900,4,-1,-1
1, I went shopping . ,0,900,4,-1,-1

1," No , it wasn't expensive . It was on sale for 20 dollars . ",0,900,4,-1,-1
0, That's cheap . ,0,900,4,-1,-1
1, I know . It was a really good deal . ,0,900,4,-1,-1
0, I don't think you'll need to wear it for a while . It's been really hot lately . ,0,900,4,-1,-1
0,"Hi , Victor . How are you ? ",1,901,4,-1,-1
1," Oh , I'm fine . ",0,901,4,-1,-1
0," So , are you going to go to class tonight ? ",1,901,4,-1,-1
1, Maybe ... but I don't think so . ,0,901,4,-1,-1
0, Really ? What's the matter ? ,1,901,4,-1,-1
1, I don't know . I'm just feeling a little sad . ,0,901,4,-1,-1
0," Listen . Come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . ",2,901,4,-1,-1
1," Now that's a good idea . Thanks a lot , Brian . I'm feeling better already . ",3,901,4,-1,-1
0,How's John doing ? ,1,902,4,-1,-1
1, He can barely make ends meet . ,0,902,4,-1,-1
0,The Phoenix team overpowered its counterpart 86 to 50 . ,0,903,4,-1,-1
1, They're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . ,0,903,4,-1,-1
0," If the Phoenix beats the Rocket , it will enter the final . ",0,903,4,-1,-1
1," No way , if it still has 21 . ",0,903,4,-1,-1
0,What's that book you have under your arm ? ,1,904,4,-1,-1
1, It's the best seller everyone's been talking about for the last six months . ,0,904,4,-1,-1
0, How in the world did you get a copy ? I've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and I'm still waiting my turn . ,1,904,4,-1,-1
1, I checked it out of the rental library . It only costs five cents a day . ,0,904,4,-1,-1
0, Is it really worth paying for ? ,1,904,4,-1,-1
1, I can't tell yet . I haven't got beyond the first chapter . ,0,904,4,-1,-1
0," If it's any good , I'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . ",0,904,4,-1,-1
0,"Come on , you are left behind ! ",0,905,4,-1,-1
1," Wow , I can't catch my breath . You are running too fast , honey . ",0,905,4,-1,-1
0, You just need more exercise . ,0,905,4,-1,-1
1," Yes , but you need to slow down . This is jogging , not racing ! ",0,905,4,-1,-1
0, I don't care . I want to burn up my fat . ,0,905,4,-1,-1
1, But running so fast is not good for people over forties . ,0,905,4,-1,-1
0, Why ? ,1,905,4,-1,-1
1, We are not as athletic as we were when young . Mild exercise is more suitable for us . ,0,905,4,-1,-1
0, But I want to burn up more calories ! ,0,905,4,-1,-1
1," In fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . ",0,905,4,-1,-1
0, Really ? I will slow down then . ,1,905,4,-1,-1
0,"Hello , Daisy , how are you doing ? ",1,906,4,-1,-1
1," Fine , thank you . I haven ’ t seen you for quite some time . What have you been up to recently ? ",1,906,4,-1,-1
0," I have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you wouldn't have seen me . Recently , I've been obsessed with horror films . ",0,906,4,-1,-1
1," Oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? They're so scary . ",1,906,4,-1,-1
0," Yeah , you are right I used to not watch horror films , but after seeing Silence of the Lamb with Mike last month , I fell in love with them . ",0,906,4,-1,-1
1," It's amazing . But if I were you , I wouldn't have the courage to watch the first one . ",0,906,4,-1,-1
0, But it's really exciting . ,0,906,4,-1,-1
1," Maybe , but I would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . I wouldn't dare sleep at night after watching one . ",0,906,4,-1,-1
0, Basically . you'll watch any type of movie except horror . ,0,906,4,-1,-1
1, Yep . ,0,906,4,-1,-1
0, I think you should have a try someday . Maybe you'll change your mind . ,0,906,4,-1,-1
1," Maybe . After all , I am grown up now . ",0,906,4,-1,-1
0,"It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession . ",0,907,4,-1,-1
1, The economy has been stagnant for a while now . We've been in a recessive state for several months already . What worries me the most is the trade deficit . I think the government should do more to encourage exports . ,0,907,4,-1,-1
0," Increasing exports would weaken the currency . I think the main point is economic growth . We need more jobs . Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . If more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . ",0,907,4,-1,-1
1," It's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? If unemployment falls , there's pressure to increase pay . That would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . ",0,907,4,-1,-1
0,Are you an art aficionado ? ,1,908,4,-1,-1
1," Not really . I like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . I hardly know anything about art or sculpture . You are a true art lover , aren ’ t you ? ",1,908,4,-1,-1
0," I love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . ",0,908,4,-1,-1
1, I never understand the meaning of those painting . They are too abstract for me . I didn ’ t pay much attention in art class at school . ,0,908,4,-1,-1
0, Art isn ’ t for everyone . I ’ m going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . It ’ s an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . ,0,908,4,-1,-1
1," I like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or Greece . What time are you thinking of going ? I ’ d love to go with you . ",1,908,4,-1,-1
0, I thought I ’ d have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . Does that sound ok to you ? Bus 51 goes directly there . ,2,908,4,-1,-1
1, That sounds fine . What time shall we meet at the bus stop ? ,1,908,4,-1,-1
0, Let ’ s meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . ,3,908,4,-1,-1
0,"What does your mother do , may I ask ? ",1,909,4,-1,-1
1, My mother works in a company as an accountant . ,0,909,4,-1,-1

1, Let me see . The one goes for $ 17 . ,0,959,4,-1,-1
0, Would you take $ 12 ? ,2,959,4,-1,-1
1," No , I can ’ t let you have it for 12.How about 14 ? ",2,959,4,-1,-1
0, 13.50 ? ,2,959,4,-1,-1
1," Sorry , $ 14 is the lowest I can go . ",3,959,4,-1,-1
0,I ’ m afraid I spoke in all of the table clock . ,0,960,3,-1,-1
1, Never mind about that . ,0,960,3,-1,-1
0," I ’ m terribly sorry , Won ’ t you let me pay for ? ",2,960,3,-1,-1

1," Not bad , But she's as busy as before . ",0,961,4,-1,-1
0,"Whatever we do , we should do it above board . ",0,962,4,-1,-1
1, You are right . We shouldn't do anything under the table . ,0,962,4,-1,-1
0," Well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . ",0,962,4,-1,-1
0,"Morning , Zina . Just wanted to say thanks again ! ",0,963,4,-1,-1
1," Hi , Vince . Thanks for stopping by . How's the work coming along for the online auction ? ",1,963,4,-1,-1

0, Yeah that would be cool ! Maybe I can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! Maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! Or what about a flame thrower ! ,3,965,4,-1,-1
1," Whoa , take it easy there Rambo . Don ’ t get carried away . These weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . There are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . For example , never handle a weapon that you haven ’ t inspected yourself . Always make sure there isn ’ t anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! ",0,965,4,-1,-1
0," Wow , I didn ’ t know ! It always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! ",0,965,4,-1,-1
1," The reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! So are you ready ? ",1,965,4,-1,-1
0, Let ’ s do it ! ,0,965,4,-1,-1
0,"Hi , Jim . How are you ? I haven ’ t seen you for a while . ",1,966,4,-1,-1
1, I ’ m fine . I ’ Ve been out of town . I just got back . ,0,966,4,-1,-1

0,"What's the problem , Nada ? You look down in the dumps . ",1,968,4,-1,-1
1, I don't know . My life is a big mess . Everything is so complicated . ,0,968,4,-1,-1

1," no , of course not . He is still single . ",0,968,4,-1,-1
0, then what's your problem ? ,1,968,4,-1,-1
1, I try to keep it to myself . But there is a lot of gossip about us . ,0,968,4,-1,-1
0," oh , I see . Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . ",0,968,4,-1,-1
1," worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . ",0,968,4,-1,-1
0, office romance is very tricky . ,0,968,4,-1,-1
1, it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed . ,0,968,4,-1,-1
0," cheer up , Nada . You'll be fine . ",2,968,4,-1,-1
0,You're not looking happy . What's the matter ? ,1,969,4,-1,-1
1," Oh , nothing special . I'm just a bit tired . ",0,969,4,-1,-1

1," With everything , with everybody , with all this ! ",0,969,4,-1,-1
0, A good suggestion for you . You need a holiday . ,2,969,4,-1,-1
1," It wasn't always like this , you know . ",3,969,4,-1,-1
0, What do you mean ? ,1,969,4,-1,-1
1," Well , I mean . We always do the same thing . There's no variety in our lives . ",0,969,4,-1,-1
0, You need a holiday . That's what's the matter . ,2,969,4,-1,-1
1," Certainly , perhaps . ",3,969,4,-1,-1
0,"I wonder what he looks like . Oh , I can't wait to see him ! His email said he'd be wearing a white hat . ( looking around for him ) oh , there is . ",0,970,4,-1,-1
1," Hey , Isabelle ... ",0,970,4,-1,-1
0, Logan ! Why on earth are you hiding here ? White hat ! Come on ! Don't tell me you're the guy ! It can't be true . ,0,970,4,-1,-1
1," Yes , I am the guy . ",0,970,4,-1,-1
0, What a bummer ! You set me up ? ,1,970,4,-1,-1
1, Let me explain . I didn't mean to hurt you ... ,0,970,4,-1,-1
0, How dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) ,0,970,4,-1,-1
1," Hang on one second . Hear me out , just this once , Isabella ! ",0,970,4,-1,-1
0, Why did you lie to me in the email ? ,1,970,4,-1,-1
1, I didn't lie . You just didn't ask me my real name . ,0,970,4,-1,-1
0, I should have known it was you . No wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . I thought I might have found the one for me . ,0,970,4,-1,-1
1," I'm sorry . It was cruel of me . But I promise it will never happen again ? Look , there's a nice restaurant . Let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . ",0,970,4,-1,-1
0,"Peter , how often do you exercise ? ",1,971,4,-1,-1

0, What do you drink ? ,1,971,4,-1,-1
1," Well , I never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . They are very bad for you . ",0,971,4,-1,-1
0, What do you drink ? ,1,971,4,-1,-1
0,Did you watch the volleyball match last night ? ,1,972,4,-1,-1
1, Yeah . ,0,972,4,-1,-1
0, Who won ? ,1,972,4,-1,-1
1, China . ,0,972,4,-1,-1
0, What was the score ? ,1,972,4,-1,-1
1, China beat Brazil 3 to 0 . ,0,972,4,-1,-1
0, Wonderful ! ,0,972,4,-1,-1
0,"Even if our company didn't have a dress code , I still think people would wear formal clothing to work . ",0,973,4,-1,-1
1, I wouldn't be so sure ... People want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . ,0,973,4,-1,-1
0," Maybe that's true for some positions , but I think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . They dress for success ! You can't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . It's just not respectful to you client . ",0,973,4,-1,-1
1," I think what you wear is so overrated . I would rather have a down-to-earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . ",0,973,4,-1,-1
0," It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . ",0,973,4,-1,-1
1," Maybe you're right , but I'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! ",0,973,4,-1,-1
0,Isn't it wonderful walking here ? ,1,974,4,-1,-1
1, What do you mean ? ,1,974,4,-1,-1
0, I mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . ,0,974,4,-1,-1
1," Yes , look over there . That's the Empire State Building . My book says it's 102 stories tall . ",0,974,4,-1,-1
0, It's quite famous but don't you think it looks a bit old-fashioned ? ,1,974,4,-1,-1
1," You're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . ",0,974,4,-1,-1
0, What other important buildings are we going to see on Fifth Avenue ? ,1,974,4,-1,-1
1, Quite a number . Actually every skyscraper has a history . A few blocks ahead we'll see St.Patrick ' s Cathedral and just across the street will be the world-renowed Rockefeller Center . It's a landmark in the history of architecture . ,0,974,4,-1,-1
0, What's there after that ? ,1,974,4,-1,-1
1," Well then , there's a Central Park . Facing the park on Fifth Avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . ",0,974,4,-1,-1
0, What are they all for ? ,1,974,4,-1,-1
1," Most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . New York is one of the financial centers of the world . And there are lots of very expensive places . ",0,974,4,-1,-1
0,"Hey Kevin , what are you doing here ? Don't you usually spend Tuesday nights at home studying ? ",1,975,4,-1,-1
1, I needed to get out of the house . My parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . ,0,975,4,-1,-1
0, What did she tell them ? Is she dropping out of college ? ,1,975,4,-1,-1
1, Nothing that serious . She finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . ,0,975,4,-1,-1
0, And your parents took it badly ? ,1,975,4,-1,-1
1, That's putting it mildly . My father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . ,0,975,4,-1,-1
0," Ouch , that sounds bad . What did your sister do ? ",1,975,4,-1,-1
1," She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . ",0,975,4,-1,-1
0, How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? ,1,975,4,-1,-1
1, Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage . ,0,975,4,-1,-1
0, Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea . ,1,975,4,-1,-1
1, What do you mean ? ,1,975,4,-1,-1
0," Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not . ",0,975,4,-1,-1
1," I guess so . Better to find out now than after you're married , when it's harder to get out . ",0,975,4,-1,-1
0,Do you think they two will get married ? ,1,976,4,-1,-1
1," Yeah , you can count on it . ",0,976,4,-1,-1
0," I think so . Yes , they get along so well . ",0,976,4,-1,-1
1, I like him . He's good for her . ,0,976,4,-1,-1
0, You're right . He sure is . ,0,976,4,-1,-1
0,What do you think of Frank ? ,1,977,4,-1,-1
1, He is all right . But I think he seems to have no back bone . ,0,977,4,-1,-1
0, Why do you say that ? ,1,977,4,-1,-1
1," Whatever things get tough , he gives in . ",0,977,4,-1,-1
0,Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight . ,0,978,4,-1,-1
1, Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark . ,0,978,4,-1,-1
0, I sure hope so . ,0,978,4,-1,-1
0,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ? ",1,979,1,-1,-1
1," Oh , we never speak Spanish in class ! Miss.Parker speaks to us only in English . ",0,979,1,-1,-1
0, I suppose she's right . Does she speak English very slowly ? ,1,979,1,-1,-1
1, Not always . Sometimes we don't understand her . Then she has to repeat what she said . ,0,979,1,-1,-1
0, It must be interesting to study English . ,0,979,1,-1,-1
1, Mario and I are the best students in the class . Miss.Parker says that my pronunciation is very good . ,0,979,1,-1,-1
0, Is English pronunciation easy or difficult ? ,1,979,1,-1,-1
1, Sometimes it's difficult . Some words look different from the way one pronounces them . ,0,979,1,-1,-1
0,It's quiet everywhere in winter . ,0,980,4,-1,-1
1, Yes . I like winter . ,0,980,4,-1,-1
0, Me too . ,0,980,4,-1,-1
1, It's snowing heavily . What about taking a walk ? ,2,980,4,-1,-1
0, That's a good idea . Let's go ! ,3,980,4,-1,-1
1, What a heavy snow ! Look ! The water is frozen . ,0,980,4,-1,-1
0, Take care ! Don't slip on the ground . ,0,980,4,-1,-1
1, I've got it . I like the feeling of stepping on the ice . ,0,980,4,-1,-1
0, Yes . Very wonderful . ,0,980,4,-1,-1
1, There is a snowman over there . ,0,980,4,-1,-1
0, How lovely it is ! ,0,980,4,-1,-1
0,Tim's always bothering me . ,0,981,4,-1,-1
1, Just tell him off . ,0,981,4,-1,-1
0,Who are those guys ? ,1,982,4,-1,-1
1," Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O ’ Neal , they are the Los Angeles Lakers ’ star players . ",0,982,4,-1,-1
0, Oh . ,0,982,4,-1,-1
1," Wait a second . He shoots , he scores ! ",0,982,4,-1,-1
0, All right ! ,0,982,4,-1,-1
1," Here comes Jordan , though . ",0,982,4,-1,-1
0," Wow , Michael Jordan ’ s slam-dunks are beautiful things to watch . ",0,982,4,-1,-1
1," Yeah . He ’ s older , so he doesn ’ t slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it ’ s still amazing . ",0,982,4,-1,-1
0, Which team do you think will win ? ,1,982,4,-1,-1
1, The Lakers . Jordan is the only good player Washington has . ,0,982,4,-1,-1
0,"I am sorry to trouble you again , Mr.Stone . ",0,983,1,-1,-1
1, It's ok . What do you want to ask ? ,1,983,1,-1,-1
0, Where should I go after I arrived at the university ? ,1,983,1,-1,-1
1, The first place you should go is the International Center . ,2,983,1,-1,-1
0, Why ? ,1,983,1,-1,-1
1, You can get help there in dealing with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service ; you can find Foreign Student Advisers . ,2,983,1,-1,-1
0, What kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? ,1,983,1,-1,-1
1," They'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . ",0,983,1,-1,-1
0, Can we get any more help at the International Center ? ,1,983,1,-1,-1
1," Yes , a lot more . If you go there just before the beginning of the fall's semester , you can get your student ID and social security number there . They will keep your documents up-to-date . They will offer an orientation program for new comers . They will also help you contact your department and registration office . ",2,983,1,-1,-1
0, I see . It must be worth going to . ,3,983,1,-1,-1
1," Besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . In cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the International Center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . ",0,983,1,-1,-1

1," It sure is . They also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . The Center staff members are also friendly and helpful . Everyone loves them . ",0,983,1,-1,-1
0,"hi , Lander . What's wrong ? ",1,984,3,-1,-1
1, I can hardly make ends meet these days . ,0,984,3,-1,-1
0, same here . I have't brought any new clothes for three months . ,0,984,3,-1,-1
1, my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . ,0,984,3,-1,-1
0, true . The news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . ,0,984,3,-1,-1
1, definitely . I have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . ,0,984,3,-1,-1
0," the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . ",0,984,3,-1,-1
