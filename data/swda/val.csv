1,"Uh-huh,  /",29,25,0,40,-1
1,uh-huh. /,29,25,0,40,-1

1,Right. /,6,25,0,40,-1
0,"-- in a nursing home,  /",42,25,0,40,-1

1,and get that youth back. /,35,25,0,40,-1
0,Yeah. /,6,25,0,40,-1
1,"{D You know, } sometimes that even helps them, just being around young people to, because some of them are so, {F um, } just stationary -- /",35,25,0,40,-1
0,Right. /,6,25,0,40,-1
1,"-- {E I mean, } they'll get in a wheelchair  /",35,25,0,40,-1
1,{C or } they'll just sit in a chair  /,35,25,0,40,-1
1,"[ {C and, } + {C and, } ] until you come along and really try and pump them up, they're just stationary,  /",35,25,0,40,-1
1,"{C and } I feel like, gosh, that's all they do all day long.  /",8,25,0,40,-1
1,"{C So } I do, love to see young kids go [ and, + and ] men take the pets and everything.  /",8,25,0,40,-1
1,"I think that's a real, real neat idea. /",35,25,0,40,-1
0,"Yeah,  /",29,25,0,40,-1
0,"I think you do get more [ by stimul-, + by stimulation. ]  /",35,25,0,40,-1
