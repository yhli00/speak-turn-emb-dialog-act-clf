1,"Oh, uh-huh. /",5,1026,5,5,-1

1,Uh-huh. /,6,1026,5,5,-1
0,On the other hand I know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars I have. /,35,1026,5,5,-1

0,"you've got to get people to see i-, - /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,"and surprisingly enough just handling of trash, uh, can cut pollution, uh, from, uh, uh, from just throwing it in a dump, or, or, or, where ever else they used to do with it, maybe used to burn it.  /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,They've stopped that up here too. /,8,1026,5,5,-1
1,Uh-huh. /,6,1026,5,5,-1

1,"I'm not sure if, if our state inspection ever-, - /",8,1026,5,5,-1
1,"once a year has to do, you know, - /",8,1026,5,5,-1
1,"if they check the, uh, -/",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"Uh-huh,  /",6,1026,5,5,-1
0,"well if they don't I would imagine in time they'll get a law with. i-, get around to it,  /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,"and if they don't then that's something I would certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh, -/",35,1026,5,5,-1
1,"Oh, I would <laughter>. /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"Yeah,  /",6,1026,5,5,-1
0,yeah. /,6,1026,5,5,-1
1,"I'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or, or, or anything. /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"Oh yeah,  /",29,1026,5,5,-1
0,"I, I agree.  /",29,1026,5,5,-1
0,Now that's another area we haven't even discussed  /,8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"and that is water pollution and various of the other types of, uh, of, uh, like food pollution.  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"I mean you, you hardly ever hear, hear anybody say anything about food pollution.  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"But I think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries,  /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,"so, uh, hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of, uh, pollutants in our food.  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"But water pollution, uh, - /",32,1026,5,5,-1
0,"I've worried, especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like. /",8,1026,5,5,-1
1,Uh-huh. /,6,1026,5,5,-1
0,I know a lot more people are going to bottled water. /,8,1026,5,5,-1
1,Well - /,19,1026,5,5,-1
1,and that's not necessarily the answer either  /,35,1026,5,5,-1
1,because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap. /,8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"Yeah,  /",6,1026,5,5,-1
0,"tap,  /",2,1026,5,5,-1
0,yeah <laughter>. /,32,1026,5,5,-1
1,"So, - /",32,1026,5,5,-1
1,"but a lot of these, uh, - /",32,1026,5,5,-1
1,some of this - /,32,1026,5,5,-1
1,"well, you know, a lot of people have well water,  /",35,1026,5,5,-1
1,in fact in this area too  /,8,1026,5,5,-1
1,"and, an, you know, - /",32,1026,5,5,-1
1,"and, uh, -/",32,1026,5,5,-1
0,Uh-huh. /,6,1026,5,5,-1
1,"if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're, what you're drinking  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
1,"and I, I know a lot of people, you know, have that  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
1,"and, you know, you have to wonder if that, you know could have an adverse affect on them too,",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,Yeah. /,6,1026,5,5,-1
1,"if they don't, i-, they don't get it checked. /",42,1026,5,5,-1
0,"Yeah,  /",6,1026,5,5,-1
0,"I'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course, have it checked  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"because it seems, uh, - /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,"when I was a kid growing up down south, uh, I used to go out in the country where my grandparents were  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"and we had a well,  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"it was one of those draws that, - /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,"I forget what you call those things, /",8,1026,5,5,-1
1,Uh-huh. /,6,1026,5,5,-1
0,"and, and that was some of the best tasting water,  /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,"I mean, I can still to this day taste that water. /",8,1026,5,5,-1
1,"When we were, - /",32,1026,5,5,-1
1,"when I was growing up I lived in Huntsville, Alabama, /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,Yeah. /,6,1026,5,5,-1
1,"and their water supply came from, uh, spring. /",8,1026,5,5,-1
0,Uh-huh. /,6,1026,5,5,-1
1,"And it was like ice cold, spring water  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
1,"and I guess parts of the, the city still ha-, you know, get that,  /",8,1026,5,5,-1
1,"but, uh, that was, that was really wonderful. /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,"Oh, I bet it was. /",11,1026,5,5,-1
1,"It was really, really good. /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,"Yeah,  /",6,1026,5,5,-1
0,"the-, - /",32,1026,5,5,-1
0,"once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well, filtered through all the earth and everything I think that, uh, - /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,it depends of course where you are.  /,35,1026,5,5,-1
0,"A good well, though, I think is very healthy ... /",35,1026,5,5,-1
0,"Um, /",6,1027,17,1,-1
1,Hi <laughter>. /,20,1027,17,1,-1
0,one thing you know that I always think about when I think of public education - /,8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"cause I went through the public, um, school system of Boston, /",8,1027,17,1,-1
1,Uh-huh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"and, uh, I always felt that I graduated high school  /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"and I still didn't even I, I couldn't put together a map of the United State. /",8,1027,17,1,-1
1,Um. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,You know what I mean. /,34,1027,17,1,-1
1,Uh-huh. /,40,1027,17,1,-1
0,An yet I felt that I got a good education  /,35,1027,17,1,-1
0,"and I, I did well in school  /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"but you tell me to name, you know, five continents  /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"an I,",8,1027,17,1,-1
1,Uh-huh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,couldn't do it.  /,42,1027,17,1,-1
0,"I just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education, /",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Uh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"and the people are, are leaving school (( )) not even knowing some common sense things. /",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Yeah.  /,6,1027,17,1,-1
1,"One, - /",32,1027,17,1,-1
1,"well, talking about public education, um, I'm, we're doing a proposal, /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,Uh-huh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
1,"it's, we're doing it at N C State, /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,Yeah. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
1,"we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum, /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,Uh-huh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
1,So that's kind of in a higher level <laughter>. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
0,Right. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
1,So it's interesting that you chose that topic <laughter>. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
0,"Yeah,  /",6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"um, did you do through a public school system or private? /",34,1027,17,1,-1
1,"Yeah,  /",40,1027,17,1,-1
1,"well, I went through private an until ninth grade. /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"Uh-huh,  /",5,1027,17,1,-1
0,did you notice a big difference? /,34,1027,17,1,-1
1,"Oh, yeah,  /",40,1027,17,1,-1
1,a big difference. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
0,Like in what sense? /,17,1027,17,1,-1
1,"Well, um, in, uh, public schools I guess there wer-, there are a lot of, of, you know, - /",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,people can take lower level courses an get away with learning nothing. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
0,Uh-huh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
1,"But, um, private school you couldn't do that, /",35,1027,17,1,-1
0,Uh-huh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
1,you had to learn. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
0,"Yeah,  /",6,1027,17,1,-1
0,I work in a temporary agency  /,8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"an they're people that come in, you know, every day to fill out an application, /",8,1027,17,1,-1
1,Uh-huh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"and they'll have to bring somebody with them,  /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"and they will show that they completed, um, four year of high school,  /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application,",8,1027,17,1,-1
1,Uh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"they can't read enough to be able to fill out the answers by themselves, /",42,1027,17,1,-1
1,That's bad. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
0,it's just incredible. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
1,"Yeah,  /",6,1027,17,1,-1
1,"our State cut a whole bunch of a, I think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget. /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,Really. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
1,So they're making all kind of cuts  /,8,1027,17,1,-1
1,"in college people cannot, I mean, the teachers can't make tests any more,  /",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,"and th-, the library canceling all of it's subscriptions. /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,Yeah. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
1,It's pretty sorry. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
0,"I know,  /",29,1027,17,1,-1
0,"um, they, uh, - /",32,1027,17,1,-1
0,I forget - /,8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"I think it's, um, some place in New York because they're having budget problems,",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Uh-huh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,they're closing the libraries.  /,42,1027,17,1,-1
0,"I mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports,",8,1027,17,1,-1
1,Uh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"or anything like that,  /",42,1027,17,1,-1
0,they're not cutting in any other corner  /,8,1027,17,1,-1
0,they're closing the libraries.  /,8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"That to me shows a little, uh, switch in priorities. /",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Yeah. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,You know.  /,32,1027,17,1,-1
0,So do you go to college right now?  /,34,1027,17,1,-1

1,most of my life. /,42,1027,17,1,-1
0,I see. /,5,1027,17,1,-1
1,And now I'm back here going to school. /,8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"Well, pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college. /",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Yeah. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,It's just a outrageously expensive. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Luckily state <laughter> is one of the cheap ones. /,8,1027,17,1,-1
0,Oh is it. /,34,1027,17,1,-1
1,Yeah. /,40,1027,17,1,-1

1,Yeah. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,That's good.  /,11,1027,17,1,-1
0,I went to a private university  /,8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"and, um, I don't know  /",23,1027,17,1,-1
0,I look back now  /,8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"and I, I think that I probably would have done it differently if I, um, you know, could do it over again. /",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Yeah. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"But, um, I have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school, some, some of them,  /",8,1027,17,1,-1

1,<Laughter>. /,26,1027,17,1,-1
0,I really do  /,8,1027,17,1,-1

0,It's in Massachusetts.  /,8,1027,17,1,-1

1,Oh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"And I know that I'm drawing a lot of what I learned in school, you know,  /",35,1027,17,1,-1
0,"I, I probably just subconsciously rely a lot on, on art.  /",35,1027,17,1,-1

1,Uh-huh. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"no pulling hair or anything like that,  /",8,1027,17,1,-1

0,"um, there's a large minority population.  /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"And, um, she's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there - /",8,1027,17,1,-1
0,"I think they don't value that type of student as much as you get,",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Yeah  /,6,1027,17,1,-1

0,"I mean the do teachers get, - /",32,1027,17,1,-1
0,I mean personally I would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Yeah. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,"And seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in, in areas and just watching them get better, you know. /",35,1027,17,1,-1
1,Yeah. /,6,1027,17,1,-1
0,That's not much of a challenge. /,35,1027,17,1,-1
